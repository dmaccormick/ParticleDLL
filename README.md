# C++ Particle System DLL for Unity

# Introduction
This project was made as an assignment for a 3rd year Engines class in 2018. We were tasked with building a C++ DLL to control a box-emitting particle system within Unity.

# Code Overview
The Wrapper.h and Wrapper.cpp files contain all of the entry points to the DLL. These files then use the data structures in the other files to generate and manage a particle system on the C++ side.
